NIZI Power 12V is Nepal's first power backup solution characterized by simplicity and minimalist design. With an emphasis on user-friendliness and portability, it is a game-changer for areas in Nepal plagued by unreliable power supply and frequent outages.

With a local research, design, and engineering infrastructure, NIZI Power 12V proudly carries the "Made in Nepal" tag, embodying the essence of durability and resilience. This initiative marks the debut of Yarsa Tech, which aims to promote Nepali products while discouraging the use of unauthorized, expensive foreign alternatives.
