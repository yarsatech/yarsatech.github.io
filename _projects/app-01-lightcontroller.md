Click! That's the sound of you switching off that part of your brain that turns lights on and off. Our Automatic
Light Controller will keep track of several luminiousity variables to turn your lamps on and off without you
even having to think about it.

This project is being build to explore plastic injection molding and as an experiment to find out if it is feasible to
assemble DIY PCBs in Nepal at a massive scale.
