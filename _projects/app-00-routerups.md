To rescue the internet-wandering technophiles everywhere from the rude interruptions of reality, Yarsa Tech is working tirelessly, building an awesome, easily-installed piece of power backup hardware that lets the internet work for hours in the likely case of unforeseen power losses, ensuring that no video call loses connection, no game is lost, no interview cut short

This project is an exploration into power-management for portable devices, and we
plan on using what we learn to create even cooler portable devices.
