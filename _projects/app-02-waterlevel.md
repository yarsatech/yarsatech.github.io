Conquer Stairs, the ultimate enemy. You never have to walk up the stairs to the terrace to check the water tank, only to walk all the way to the basement turn the motor on. Overflowing tanks are a thing of the past, and if in the twenty-first century, you still manually
monitor your water tanks, you have lost at life. Thank you.
